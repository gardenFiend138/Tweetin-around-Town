# What's the Word in San Jose?

---

## Motivations
__Code for San Jose__ is a volunteer group that works on civic projects for the benefit of the residents of San Jose. This project was conceptualized by the founder, _____________ , with the Tunnel of Lights at City Hall in mind. She thought it would be interesting to see what residents and visitors were tweeting about while visiting this public art installation. 

## Overview 
This project will consist of two main data visualizations: a heatmap of Tweets laid over a map of San Jose, and a visualization of hashtags by frequency. This will also have a live feed of Tweets within San Jose, which will be tied to both of the data visualizations, so they change in real time to match what's being talked about in San Jose.

### Wireframe

## Technologies Used 
This project will use Rails on the backend, utilize web sockets to connect to the Twitter API, Google Maps API for the map of San Jose and the heatmap, and D3.js for the secondary data visualization of trending Tweets. The backend will be written in Ruby, and the frontend will be written in JavaScript, with the help of the D3 library.
